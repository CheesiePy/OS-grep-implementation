## 📝 Description

This project simulates the Unix `grep` command.  
It searches for a user-defined substring across one or more files (or standard input) and prints each line that contains the substring.

After processing each file, the program prints how many matching lines were found in that file.

## 🧪 Usage

### Compile:
```bash
gcc grep.c -o grep
